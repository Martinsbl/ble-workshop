This workshop consist of three parts:

[Part 1: Getting familiar with Segger Embedded Studio.](./Part_1.md)
This first part of the workshop is intended to give a very quick introduction to the look and feel of Segger Embedded Studio and to give you an idea about how it is to work with Nordic's SDK. If you are already familiar with SES you can skip this part an move on to part 2.

[Part 2: Setting up the PWM driver.](./Part_2.md) 
The goal of this part is to learn how to use the drivers in the SDK. To do that, we will add an use the PWM drivers to control a servo.

[Part 3: Adding a BLE Service.](./Part_3.md)
In this part we will take a quick look at how to set up a GATT service and characteristic using the SDK. The goal is to use nRF Connect for mobile to send commands via BLE to control the servo.
