# Part 3: Adding a BLE Service
In this part we will add a service and a characteristic that we can use to control our servo. Adding services and characteristics can be a complex task with a lot of things to consider, such as security aspects, characteristic properties, etc. However, since this workshop is so short we will just power through and skip everything that has to do with security and low level configurations, and just implement the bare minimum of what we need.
